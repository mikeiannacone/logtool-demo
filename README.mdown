## Webapp Demo

This project also includes a simple webapp, to demonstrate the use of these various components. 

To launch this demo:

1. launch redis with `redis-server` (and `flushall` if needed)
2. from the webserver directory: `node server.js`
3. visit `localhost:8000` in any modern browser
4. run logtool (note: if you change the channel names in output.json, you will then also need to modify which channels the webapp demo listens on)
